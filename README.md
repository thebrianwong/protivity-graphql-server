# Provitity <s>GraphQL Server</s> AWS Lambda Function

An <s>Apollo GraphQL server</s> AWS Lambda function used to make API requests to Google Vertex API to generate random fun facts on behalf of
[Protivity](https://github.com/thebrianwong/protivity).

<s>It is containerized and deployed using AWS ECS.</s>

This was too expensive, so I rewrote the app and deployed it as an AWS Lambda function. Ignore the repo name.
